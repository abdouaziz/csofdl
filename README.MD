# Project Description and Setup Guide

Welcome to the repository! This document provides a comprehensive overview of all our code and project files, as well as instructions for setting up and running the project successfully in class.

## Installation and Setup

Before proceeding with the installation and setup process, ensure that you have Conda installed on your system. Conda is a package and environment management system that will help streamline the setup process.

1. **Create a Conda Environment:**

   First, create a new Conda environment for this project using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda create --name name_of_env python=3.10
   ```

   Replace `name_of_env` with your preferred name for the Conda environment.

2. **Activate the Conda Environment:**

   Once the environment is created, activate it with the following command:

   ```bash
   conda activate name_of_env
   ```

   Replace `name_of_env` with the name you chose earlier.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   With the environment activated, you can install all the project's required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Run the Project:**

   After successfully installing the dependencies, you're ready to run the project. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This command will initiate the project's main functionality, and you'll see [describe the expected outcome or behavior of the project].

Congratulations! You have now set up and executed the project successfully.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation or setup process, here are a few common solutions:

- **Conda Installation:** If you haven't installed Conda yet, you can download it from the official Conda website and follow their installation guide.

- **Dependency Issues:** If you encounter any errors related to missing dependencies or incompatible packages, ensure that you have activated the correct Conda environment and that you have installed the dependencies from the correct `requirements.txt` file.

- **Python Version:** This project requires Python 3.10. Make sure you have this version installed in your Conda environment.
